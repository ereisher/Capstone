1. Pre-process the data using FastQC and MultiQC- files can be found in the [Pre-process folder](https://github.com/ereisher/Capstone/tree/main/Preprocess)
    - Run 'bash get_sample_name_dic.sh > sample_dic.txt' in order to get the sample list where each accession number separated by space
    - Copy the sample_dic.txt to the qc.slurm for the 'sample_name' variable
    - Make directory called 'qc' and make a sub-directory called 'script_output'
    - Edit the paths in line 8, 9, 20, 30, 31, and 41 then run qc.slurm

2. Run Qiime2- files can be found in the qiime2 folder (each group has their own files)
    - Make directory called 'qiime2' and make sure QIIME2 version 2021.4 installed with all of the plugins listed above.
    - Build the manifest file using the 'manifest_builder.py' by specifiying -i acc_list_file -p path_to_the_raw_reads
    - Get the latest release for the reference database (SILVA).
    - Naive Bayes classifiers trained on Silva classifiers are available here: [Database](https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/data-resources/#taxonomy-classifiers-for-use-with-q2-feature-classifier)
    - Make sure these files are included in the 'qiime2' directory: metadata.tsv, manifest, and reference database
    - Before running 'clean_reads.slurm' check the following:
      * Edit the path in line 8, 9, and 20
    - Run 'sbatch clean_reads.slurm'
    - Before running 'dada2.slurm' check the following:
      * Edit the path in line 8, 9, and 28
      * Values for dada2 denoising (lines 18-21) were assigned from visualizing 'demux.qzv'
    - Run'sbatch dada2.slurm'
    - Before running 'diversity_metrics.slurm' check the following:
      * Edit the path in line 8, 9, and 15
      * Sampling depth value assigned from 'table-viz.qzv'
      * Make sure that there is no directory called 'core-metrics-results'
    - Run 'sbatch diversity_metrics.slurm'
   
3. Normalization using SRS (scaling with ranked subsampling) method:
    - Download 'table.qza'.
    - Upload the 'table.qza' to the SRS Shiny app (https://vitorheidrich.shinyapps.io/srsshinyapp/) in order to choose a sampling depth (Cmin)
    - It is best to choose a Cmin which doesnâ€™t result in eliminating so many samples.
    - Add Cmin to line 7 in the 'normalized_srs.sh' script.
    - Run 'bash normalized_srs.sh' from the 'qiime2' directory
    
4. Create relative abundance plots (heatmap and barplot)- files can be found in the R folder (each group has their own files)
    - Install R version 4.1.2 and create a directory called 'qiime2_output'.
    - Note * At this time, HCC does not support the R packages needed for this step
    - Download the 'Heatmap-barplot.R', 'metadata.tsv', 'table.qza', 'taxonomy.qza' to the 'qiime2_output' directory.
    - Download the 'Heatmap-barplot.R', 'metadata.tsv', 'norm-table.qza', 'taxonomy.qza' to the 'qiime2_norm_output' directory.
    - Edit the path in line 3 from the 'Heatmap-barplot.R' script.
    - Install both the 'tidyverse' package and the 'qiime2R' package.
    - Run the rest of the code in the script.
  
5. Run sub-analysis: LEfSe, and PICRUSt2
    - LEfSe analysis steps- files can be found in the LEfSe folder (each group has their own files)
        * Install LEfSe version 1.0.
        * Make a sub-directory to 'qiime2' called 'lefse'.
        * Go to the lefse directory and make sure both 'format_rel_level.sh' and 'rel_format.py' are available in the directory.
        * Run 'format_rel_level.sh'
    - PICRUSt2 analysis steps- files can be found in the PICRUSt2 folder (each group has their own files)
        * Install PICRUSt2 version 2.4.
        * Make a sub-directory to 'qiime2' called 'picrust'.
        * Go to the picrust directory and make sure 'picrust2.slurm'is available in the directory.
        * Before running 'picrust2.slurm' script make sure to the edit the path in lines 8, 9, 13, 18, and 19
        * Once the scripted finish create a directory called 'vis-lefse' and make sure both 'format_pathway_abun.sh', and 'pathway_format.py' are available in the directory.
            * The 'format_pathway_abun.sh' is used to create a visualization for PICRUSt abundance pathway.
        * Before running the 'format_pathway_abun.sh' script make sure to the edit the path in lines 6, 9, 13, 16, and 19
        * Run the 'format_pathway_abun.sh'.

6. Running correlation and statistical analysis: alpha and beta group significant, and differential abundance (ANCOM)
    - Alpha and beta group significant- files can be found in the Stat folder (each group has their own files)
        * Make a sub-directory to the 'qiime2' called 'stat' and make sure it includes 'stat.slurm' and a sub-dirctury called 'script_output'.
        * Before running'stat.slurm' edit the path in line 8, 9, and 15.
        * Run the 'sbatch stat.slurm'
    - Differential abundance (ANCOM)- files can be found in the ANCOM folder (each group has their own files)
        * Make a sub-directory to the 'qiime2' called 'ancom' and make sure it includes 'ancom.sh'.
        * Before running 'ancom.sh' script edit the path in line 5.
        * Run the 'bash ancom.sh'.
